# Data Storage

### About

This is a class project for CS 410 Data Engineering, Winter 2021.

We used US Census data to test importing into PostgreSQL under a variety of conditions: with/without index/key, with/without logging/autocommit, using a temp table after memory tuning, importing in batch, etc..
